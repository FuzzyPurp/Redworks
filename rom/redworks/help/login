Each terminal stores it's own user account information. 
To add accounts to a terminal, once logged in, use edit "accounts.f"
you should see your name on line 1 and password on line 2. Each account
is stored like so,

username1
password1
username2
password2
username3
password3

Add guest accounts, or allow multiple accounts/logins on a specific terminal.
